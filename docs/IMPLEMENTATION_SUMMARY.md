# Project Implementation Summary

## TrustworthyCodeLLM Dashboard - Complete Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implemented code evaluation dashboard, including architecture, deployment, and usage instructions.

## Project Overview

### Objective
Develop a production-ready web application for evaluating Python code quality using hybrid analysis methods that combine static analysis with AI-powered assessment.

### Key Requirements Met
- Real-time code evaluation (not sample data)
- Professional web interface suitable for supervisor demonstration
- Integration with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent analysis
- Azure cloud deployment for public access
- Comprehensive scoring and feedback system

## Implementation Architecture

### Technology Foundation

**Web Framework**: FastAPI
- High-performance Python web framework
- Automatic API documentation
- Built-in request validation
- Asynchronous operation support

**Analysis Engine**: Dual-method approach
- AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing for structural analysis
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent code review
- Weighted scoring algorithm combining both methods

**Deployment Platform**: Azure Container Apps
- Serverless container hosting
- Automatic scaling capabilities
- Built-in load balancing
- HTTPS termination

### Core Components

**Backend Application** (`llm_app.py`):
- FastAPI server implementation
- AST analysis functions
- OpenAI API integration
- Evaluation logic and scoring
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend

**Container Configuration** (`Dockerfile-llm`):
- Python 3.9 slim base image
- Application dependencies installation
- Port exposure and startup configuration
- Production-ready container setup

**Deployment Automation** (`deploy-azure-llm.sh`):
- Azure resource provisioning
- Docker image building and pushing
- Container app deployment
- Environment configuration

## Evaluation Methodology

### AST Analysis (40% Weight)

**Structural Metrics**:
- Function and class count
- Lines of code analysis
- Complexity assessment (control structures)
- Syntax validation

**Scoring Logic**:
```python
structure_score = min(1.0, (functions + classes) / max(1, lines / 10))
```

### LLM Analysis (60% Weight)

**Evaluation Criteria**:
1. Code correctness and logic
2. Readability and style
3. Documentation quality
4. Best practices adherence
5. Problem-solving approach

**Prompt Engineering**:
- Structured system and user messages
- JSON response format requirement
- Consistent evaluation parameters
- Temperature setting of 0.3 for reproducibility

### Combined Scoring

**Algorithm**:
```
Final Score = (AST Score × 0.4) + (LLM Score × 0.6)
```

**Score Interpretation**:
- 80-100%: Production-ready code
- 60-79%: Good quality with minor improvements
- 40-59%: Functional but needs significant improvements
- 0-39%: Major issues requiring substantial revision

## Deployment Implementation

### Azure Infrastructure
